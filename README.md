# FOO-D FOR THOUGHT
## INTRO
Welcome to our app FOO-D FOR THOUGHT. Our app was designed for boot-camp students studying web development, after some research we found students needed two things, technical resources and mental wellbeing assistance, for this we created FOO-D FOR THOUGHT. 

## CONTENT


### Technical
The technical section was split into two parts one being the front-end and one being the back-end, each sections contains links to relevant resources. 

### Well-being
The well-being section was designed with the idea that students could navigate to relevant resources, depending upon their mental well-being needs.

### Footer
Throughout the app, the Footer will provide a random inspirational quote.

## How to use

### Front-end

To begin, clone this repository down to your local machine. Then run npm install to download the relevant dependencies. Once that is installed, use the command line interface (CLI) and enter the command npm start. This will initialize the app to run in your browser automatically.  

Once the page opens you will be directed to the home page, which will have two buttons directing you to each respective sections.

### Back-end

The footer components relies on the back-end running in order to retrieve the inspirational quotes.

(dummy link) To begin clone this repository down to your local machine then run npm install to download the relevant dependencies. Once that is installed use command line interface (CLI) then enter the command npm run dev this will initialize a local server on PORT 5432 that is linked to the hosting site heroku.

Now the footer will be functional and able to retrieve a random inspirational quote.
## This is a work in progress!

This is a beta website. There will be bugs, performance issues, and missing content.

## Planned Updates

### What could we have done with 1 more week?

- Dark mode
- Make the app more responsive
- More testing on features
- Accessibility (Screen reader, aria labels)
- More CRUD handlers - allow users to add to quotes etc
- Share to social media feature


### What if we had even longer?
- Live chat
- Code exercises (like codewars)
- Customisable user experience
- User authorisation (log in and log out)
