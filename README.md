## Introduction

Welcome to our app FOO-D FOR THOUGHT. Our app was designed for boot-camp students studying web development, after some research we found students needed two things, technical resources and mental wellbeing assistance, for this we created FOO-D FOR THOUGHT. 
<br><br>
## Content


### Technical
The technical section was split into two parts one being the front-end and one being the back-end, each sections contains links to relevant resources.  

### Well-being
The well-being section was designed with the idea that students could navigate to relevant resources, depending upon their mental well-being needs.

### Footer
Throughout the app, the Footer will provide a random inspirational quote.

## How to use

### Front-end

To begin, clone this repository down to your local machine. Then use the command line interface (CLI) to ```npm install``` and download the relevant dependencies. Once that is installed, enter the command ```npm start```. This will initialize the app to run in your browser automatically.  

Once the page opens you will be directed to the home page, which will have two buttons directing you to each respective sections.

To close the application use ```Ctrl+C``` in the terminal.

### Back-end

The footer components relies on the back-end running in order to retrieve the inspirational quotes.

To begin clone [this](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/w9_backend-project-neemo-ryan-harry-mino) repository down to your local machine. Then run ```npm install``` to download the relevant dependencies. Once that is installed, enter the command ```npm run dev``` this will initialize a local server on ```PORT 5432``` that is linked to the hosting site heroku.

Now the footer will be functional and able to retrieve a random inspirational quote.
